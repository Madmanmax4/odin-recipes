    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>German pancakes have been a family recipe passed down through many generations. They are a dense egg and flour based breakfast item that is usually topped with powdered surgar and/or maple syrup and any choice of fruit, my favorite are strawberries and bananas with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. With a small prep-time and only needing 20 minutes to cook, this recipe is great for a decently quick family breakfast. The edges have a nice fluffy and crisp texture while the middle has a soft egg-like feel.</p>
